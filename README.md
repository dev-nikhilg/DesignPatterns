# DesignPatterns

***Design patterns*** can be defined as typical solutions to common problems in object oriented design. They are like pre-made templates or blueprints that you can customise to solve a recurring design problem in your code. They are super useful, no matter what language or platform you use and develop for.

This repository contains the sample code for different design patterns discussed in this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5H48FA8Q0RqKLS7A49kdNvb64eiJ4ddK). In this playlist we discuss below design patterns in detail:
